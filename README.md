# Personal_Memory_Game
This repository is my CS final year project, it has the main requirements of the project but it is not perfect yet.
## Overview
The main goal of the proposed game is to create an environment in which users can continuously engage in dementia prevention activities and motivate them by making it personal. 
The game would prompt users to import personal photos to be used in the game as it will not only keep the brain active but also help them keep remember family members, places, venues etc. Moreover, different features have been considered when designing the application hence it would be used by older adults, these include difficulty
level, instructions, accessibility, and usability

## Implementation 
The game was developed by initializing a database using MySQL, and building the game using PHP, JavaScript and CSS to add functionality, features, and style. Styling CSS framework such as Bootstrap was used to add a responsive design feature to the application as it might be used by different types of devices.
