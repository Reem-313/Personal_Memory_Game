# Personal_Memory_Game
This repository is my CS final year project, it has the main requirements of the project but it is not perfect

## Abstract
Dementia is a broad word that is used to describe a variety of brain disorders affecting the patients’ cognitive and behavioural functions. This report describes a cognitive activity to help older adults and patients with a potential diagnosis of dementia that helps stimulate and maintain users’ cognitive function and long-term memory based on implementing a memory game as a web application. The main goal of the proposed game is to create an environment in which users can continuously engage in dementia-prevention activities and motivate the users by making it personal. The game would prompt users with potential diagnose of dementia to import personal photos to use in the game as it will not only keep the brain active but also help them keep remembering family members, places, venues etc. Moreover, different features have been considered in the application hence it would be used by older adults, these include difficulty level, instructions, accessibility, and usability.
The application was tested by older adults to evaluate its basic functionality. Health professionals from the NHS were contacted to discuss the impact of the application on the users. Users’ feedback and suggestions were further gathered and considered to improve the application. Feedback statics mostly show that users have found the game enjoyable and easy to navigate. 

### 1-1: Case Study
The term “dementia” refers to a syndrome that is caused by a cognitive impairment in the brain that impacts the patient’s ability of their thinking, their behaviour, and memory (W. H Organization 2018). It causes them to have trouble in remembering people and things that happened or will happen in their lives, making it difficult for them to live independently. It is one of the leading causes of disability and reliance among the elderly around the world. The number of people with dementia is gradually increasing in the ageing society around the world, with 35.6 million people in 2010 and expected to double by 2030, Figure 1.1 below taken from the Dementia Statistics Hub shows the number of people diagnosed with dementia in the UK and how it will significantly increase to over a million people in the next decades (Dementia Statistics Hub, 2022). The data suggest that the average age for people developing dementia symptoms is over 65 but it may affect younger ages as well in some cases.

Dementia is difficult not just for those who suffer from it, but also their families especially for those who provide the care needed resulting a big emotional, physical, and financial stress and concerns.  Furthermore, in 2010, a total of US $604 billion were the worldwide estimated cost of dementia. 45% for the informal care and 40% for the formal social care account for the majority of costs in high-income nations, whereas 15% direct medical costs play a far smaller role, and that cost could badly impact the health system with possibility of future increase of patients. (W. H Organization 2012; Wimo et al, 2010). 

### 1-1-1: Preventive Care 
There are medications to treat dementia, however these medications cannot restore brain damage or cure dementia. So, we should put into consideration that “prevention is better than cure” as they say and focus on preventive care to decrease the number of adults and aging people who require support by encouraging them to keep their mental and physical functions active, especially that dementia is not a natural aspect of ageing, and we should focus on early detection of the disease symptoms by families and health professionals and look into possible ways that could reduce the risk of developing this disease or delaying it. Many researchers have been investigating this issue and have confirmed that the most common promising strategies of dementia prevention include physical exercise, social interaction, daily diet etc but more importantly it was well known that cognitive activities like learning new languages, playing memory games etc have a positive effect of keeping the brain active and reduce the risk of dementia (Middleton and Yaffe, 2009; Kitakoshi et al, 2015; Rakesh et al, 2017).
